			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A traditional turn-based strategic game set in the Warring States period of Japanese history. There are two scenarios, one starting in 1560, and the other in 1582. Japan is broken up into provinces, and a large cast of historical characters is included. These are leaders of various factions, as well as unit commanders. Troops must be hired, trained and equipped, commanders trained, provinces improved, all of which take actions that must be distributed between the commanders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When invading an enemy province, there is a turn-based mini-game of the battle, with terrain depicting the province. It is possible for this battle to then go into a castle siege. Supplies of gold and rice must be provided, or the army will not be able to stay in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no mouse support, all interface being handled though the keyboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
